  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Hi! I am a passionate engineer, who loves being tasked with and solving complex challenges. I got my start in coding with Robotics at the embedded level. Ever since then I have been learning
    more and more concept. My most recent take has been with web development. I started out learning the backend and creating my own <a href="https://github.com/sdmichelini/CppWebserver">HTTP Server in C++.</a>
    After that I started to learn more backend frameworks such as <a href='https://github.com/sdmichelini/Node-API-Starter'>Express.<a/> I then started to venture down the full-stack path and begin to learn front-end
    development. After getting bored of Bootstrap, I started doing a lot of CSS customization. I also decided to learn some JS frameworks as well which are React, and most recently Vue.
